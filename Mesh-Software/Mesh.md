# Online Stores - 
For the online store, which serves as the primary repository for published features and needs to support real-time access and updates, a database management system (DBMS) is typically used. Here are some commonly used types of databases for online stores:
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS): Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.

## Requirements:
* Storage of Features: The online store must securely store all published features.
* Accessibility: Users should be able to access features stored in the online store at any time.
* Search Functionality: Implement search functionality to allow users to easily find specific features.
* Real-time Updates: Ensure that any changes made to features are immediately reflected in the online store.
* Scalability: The online store should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of features and user requests.

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Specifications:
1. Feature Storage:
  * Test Case: Publish a feature using the library/GUI.
  * Expected : The feature is successfully stored in the online store database.

2. Accessibility:
  * Test Case: Attempt to access a feature from the online store.
  * Expected : The feature is accessible and can be retrieved without any issues.

3. Search Functionality:
  * Test Case: Perform a search for a feature by name or keyword.
  * Expected : The search returns relevant results matching the search criteria.

4. Real-time Updates:
  * Test Case: Modify an existing feature and verify its status in the online store.
  * Expected : The changes to the feature are immediately reflected in the online store without delay.

5. Scalability:
  * Test Case: Simulate a large number of concurrent access requests to the online store.
  * Expected : The online store handles the increased load efficiently without performance degradation.
